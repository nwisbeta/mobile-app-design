The prototype phase involves developing an incomplete version of the mobile application to test it against the requirements. 

The prototype allows stakeholder to evaluate the first implementation of the design. Prototyping can also generate further requirements, which need to feed back into the design and implementation phases.

The prototype must use the mobile app design UI and UX elements.

During the prototype phase the development team must define the device hardware and software standard for testing the mobile app against performance standards.

Example: iPhone 7, Capacity 128 GB, Free capacity >64 GB, Software Version 11.3.1 or higher, Model MKQT2BA/A
