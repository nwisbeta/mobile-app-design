The design must:
* Address the top level and detailed level requirements
* Refer to and comply with the NWIS design standards
* Include wireframes that follow the prescribed NWIS mobile app layout
* Use wireframes and documentation to demonstrate UX, using tools the stakeholder and development teams can understand, including how the UX meets a specific requirement or requirements
* Specify UI assets
* Specify each icon and attributes (size and colour), colour palette used for page, font and font size
