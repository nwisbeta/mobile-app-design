The requirements phase documents the specific needs or opportunities that the mobile app will address. These needs should be headed by a top-level requirement, followed by a set of lower level requirements.  

The stakeholders define the requirements. Stakeholders are typically the problem owners, and/or end users.  

For example: The top-level requirement is for a mobile app that helps clinicians manage their patients better. The app needs to:

* Access patient records
* Allow clinician interaction with a patient record
* Alert a clinician when there is a deterioration in a patientâ€™s condition
* Provide functionality to allow a clinician to manage their job tasks
* Comply with NHS Wales information and clinical governance

The requirements are the Core Guidelines of mobile app development. They provide inputs to the design stage which follows. They are also a key input into verification. Testing must trace back to specific requirements.

Depending on methodology and stakeholder engagement, the design team can develop requirements in parallel (agile method) with design and implementation phases, or before design and implementation phases (waterfall method).

If the team develops requirements in parallel with design and implementation phases, then the requirements phase must refer to design standards documentation.

## Checklist

The team must follow and complete all checklists for mobile app developments.
