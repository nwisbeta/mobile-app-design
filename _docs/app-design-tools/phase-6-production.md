This phase is the stage when the mobile app is distributed at scale to the target end user audience.

The design team can make minor UX and/or UI changes such as icon positioning, font size or colours.

If the design requires major UX and/or UI changes then the development must roll back to a pre-Demonstrator phase.

## Checklist
Check that the team has completed Phase 1 (Requirements), 2 (Design), 3 (Prototype), 4 (Demonstrator) and 5 (Beta) checklists before proceeding.
