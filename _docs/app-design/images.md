Use NWIS branding images within the app - see [Branding](/app-design/branding.html).  Avoid using other images unless a real user need exists (GOV.UK Design System).  

The app design must: 
* Display images at their intended aspect ratio  
* Use PNG files (iOS Human Interface Guidelines)  
* Provide alternative text labels either immediately adjacent to the image or on selecting the image, to support screen readers - see [Accessibility](/app-design/accessibility.html) (Material.io, iOS Human Interface Guidelines)  
* Download images from a server with image caching enabled, to allow faster app loading and to reduce the size of the app itself
