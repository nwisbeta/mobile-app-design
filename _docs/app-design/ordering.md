The app design must provide ordering options to suit the type of information displayed (Material.io). These options can include:
* High to low priority
* Most to least relevant
* Alphabetical order

If required, use dynamic ordering to enable the user to manually order items, such as a patient list or to-do items, using the hold and drag gesture.

The app design must order alerts from high alert to low or no alert.
