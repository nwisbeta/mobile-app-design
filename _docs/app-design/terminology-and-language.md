## Terminology Principles

The app's text must use terms consistently throughout (iOS Human Interface Guidelines). Some terms are provided in this standard.  

Terms must be familiar, friendly, clear, and easy to understand (iOS Human Interface Guidelines).

Avoid patronising sentence constructions: for example, referring to users as 'we', 'our', 'me' and 'my', like the label My Settings (iOS Human Interface Guidelines).  

Use a readability test tool like [WebFX's read-able](https://www.webfx.com/tools/read-able/) to test content reading level.

## Language
Apps must include provision for translation to other languages using language flags.
  
If the mobile app requirements include a right-alignment language as an option, use a layout flag swap the alignment accordingly.  

## Flags
Use language flags for text fields.

## Preferred General Terms

Use these terms for labels and instruction text.
