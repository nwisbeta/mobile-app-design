The app design must distinguish between content from external sources, such as other systems, from in-app information. Highlight external source displays in NWIS Green: RGB: 151 204 57, CMYK: 49 0 89 0, HEX: #97CC39. Use interrupted underlining to further separate them.
  
In the design and implementation phases, consider:  
* How to provision open standards and APIs for integration with other systems and services  
* How to display information from external sources  
* Notifying users about sharing information with other systems and services
