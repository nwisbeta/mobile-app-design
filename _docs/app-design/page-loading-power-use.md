Aim for pages to load within 2 seconds.  

If pages do not load within 1 second, a spinner progress indicator must appear. 

Swipe down gesture must enable users to manually refresh pages, where information is regularly updated (Material.io) - see [Touch Gesture Controls](/app-design/touch-gesture-control.html).  

### Loading Indicator Appears If Page Loading is Slow

## Power Efficiency
Follow best practice app design to minimise battery drainage by the app.  
 
The menu must include controls so users can turn off and on all non-critical features, that contribute to >5% of total app power use.
