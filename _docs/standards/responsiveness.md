Apps must adapt to different orientations, screen sizes and devices including smartphones and tablets (iOS Human Interface Guidelines).

Designs must consider:
* What content has the highest priority to appear in the display 
* How to retain the overall app layout and appearance across devices 
* How to use available screen space effectively 
* Applying readability margins on larger devices to keep text lines short enough for easy reading 
* Ensuring adequate margins and spacing
